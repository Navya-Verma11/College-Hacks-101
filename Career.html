                <p class="center">Financial aid is crucial for college students as it helps them to afford the cost of higher education.

Financial aid provides assistance in the form of scholarships, grants, work-study programs, and loans. It enables students to pursue their academic goals without the burden of excessive debt. Financial aid also helps to promote diversity in higher education by providing opportunities to students from underrepresented communities. In summary, financial aid is a critical component of ensuring access to higher education and promoting equal opportunity for all students regardless of their financial background.</p>
